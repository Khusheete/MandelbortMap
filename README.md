# Mandelbort Map

This is a simple visualization of the Mandelbrot set and how it relates with the Julia set. It was made with the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/). This project was inspired by a math homework and by [El Jj's video on the subject (on youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4ICbYtBGzA).
